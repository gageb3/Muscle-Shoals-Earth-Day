Muscle Shoals Earth Day Spinup Website
=============================

Reed Willis and Gage Bays collabrated on this project to build a website example for the muscle shoals earth day. We were in contact with Nancy Muse, the pperson in charge of the website. She gave us her ideas for the website and we made them come to lie!


This website took several weeks to complete. It required lots of phone calls and real world experiences. Some of the requirments that Mrs. Nancy wished for was a photo gallery, the registration form, and her poster, along with many other things on the website. One of the issues that came about was the readability of this website, but Gage and I worked with the client and did everything to their desire, including fonts and layouts. 

--------------------------------------------

* current website here: <a target="_blank" link=https://www.shoalsearthmonth.org/>here</a>
* Our website draft here: https://reedwillis.github.io/Muscle-Shoals-Earth-Day/
* 🦭  This was an honors college project for CIS 376 at UNA.
* 📅  This website was done in March, 2025.
* ❌  An error that we are fixing is the font of the mission statement and the text readability of the entire website.

### Code that needed to be fixed: 

```html
<div class="navbar-collapse collapse show" id="xx">
      <ul class="navbar-nav">
        <li class="nav-item">
          <a class="nav-link" href="assets/docs/vendor-sponsor-form-SEDF25.pdf" target="_blank">Be a Vender/Sponsor Form!</a>
        </li>
```
<details>
  <summary>Details about issue 1</summary>
  <p>Gage and I used the link of a screenshot of the form as the form on the website, but our proffessor, Dr. Barry Cumbie, showed us how to link the actual pdf and that is much better because it is the actual thing that we were trying to link to in the first place.</p>

<h4 class="mission">Shoals Earth Month Mission Statement:<br>

      The mission of Shoals Earth Month Incorporated is to provide and support educational opportunities for individuals, families, local governments, schools, businesses, and organizations to enhance understanding of the importance and interconnectedness of all natural systems and to celebrate the beauty, biodiversity, and abundance of life on Earth.</h4>

  <summary>Details about issue 2</summary>
  <p>This is an issue that still needs to be fixed as of April 7, 2025. </p>
      <br>
      <p>The mission statement will be more readable once we get done editing the font and placement of it.</p>

```script
.banner-img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 250px;
  object-fit: cover;
  border-bottom: 3px solid black;
}
```
<details>
  <summary>Details about issue 3</summary>
  <p>The banner is set to 100% of the screen, so no matter how much you zoom in or out, the banner is constant. This really isn't an issue, but I thought it would be helpful to point out.</p>

"Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose, It's fine to celebrate success, but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure."
